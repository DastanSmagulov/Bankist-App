Bankist is a fictional online bank. It is a project introduced by Jonas Schmedtmann in order to practice DOM manipulation and user interaction. Bankist has an option to log in to the account and use different functionalities, almost like in an actual bank!(try user:ds, pin:1111, and user:me, pin:2222)
